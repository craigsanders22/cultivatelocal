<!-- ============================================ 
    This Stitch is used for content heavy interior pages
    that have no design or layout.  Often times these are 
    content silos where you talk extensively about a topic
    to educate your visitors and rank on Google for the 
    content.  These are great for pages that have a TON
    of content.  Design isn't important here, it's all 
    about making the content accessible and easy to read.

            <h2>Empowering Local Food Enterprises: The Cultivate Local Journey</h2>
            <h3>From Big League Experience to Local Food Revolution</h3>
        
            <p>
                With a rich history steeped in the high-stakes world of corporate marketing, our team at Cultivate Local Food Marketing brings an unparalleled depth of knowledge to the table. Our journey began in the bustling corridors of the "big guys," where we honed our skills and amassed years of invaluable experience. This extensive background now serves as the cornerstone of our mission: to deliver innovative, cost-efficient marketing solutions to local food businesses everywhere.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the heart of our strategy lies a unique fusion of technical prowess, creative ingenuity, and an unwavering commitment to the local food movement. Our small team of specialists draws upon a broad spectrum of experiences within the food industry, from farming and CSA's to retail and product development. This eclectic blend of backgrounds enables us to tackle challenges from multiple angles, fostering a culture of creative problem-solving in partnership with our clients. 
            </p>

           <p>The inception of Cultivate Local Food Marketing stems from a lifetime of connection to local food for our founder, Craig Sanders. Craig was raised on a family farm, where he tended a large garden, harvested sweet corn for the market, and learned about the ebb and flow of farm life. After college, he joined the sales and marketing team at Traders Point Creamery, an organic grass-fed dairy producer in Zionsville, Indiana. There, he contributed to the company's growth, enabling their products to be sold nationwide at retailers such as Whole Foods, Fresh Thyme, HEB, Natural Grocers, and more. Most recently, Craig managed an independent grocery store that prominently featured local produce and food goods, achieving great success through marketing and social media channels. Craig's passion for local food, coupled with his extensive industry experience, inspired him to establish Cultivate Local Food Marketing to assist other local food producers and retailers in achieving marketplace success.</p>
