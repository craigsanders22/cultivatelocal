## **What is your story?**

In the bustling marketplace of the 21st century, where consumers are bombarded with endless advertising, it's crucial for businesses, including small farms, to stand out. Donald Miller's StoryBrand strategy is a refreshing approach to marketing that can help small farmers connect with their customers on a deeper level. By crafting a clear and compelling narrative, farmers can engage their audience, make their products memorable, and grow their businesses organically.

**<br>**

## **What is the StoryBrand Strategy?**

Donald Miller's StoryBrand framework is a powerful marketing tool that assists businesses in clarifying their message using the timeless elements of storytelling. The strategy is based on the classic narrative structure where a hero (the customer) encounters a problem, meets a guide (the business), who provides a plan and calls them to action, leading to success and avoiding failure.

The seven elements of the StoryBrand framework are:

***A Character***: The customer who wants something.

***Has a Problem***: The challenge they need to overcome.

***And Meets a Guide:*** The business that understands their plight.

***Who Gives Them a Plan:*** The actionable steps the customer can take.

***And Calls Them to Action:*** A clear call to engage with the business.

***That Helps Them Avoid Failure:*** The potential pitfalls the plan helps avoid.

***And Ends in Success:*** The happy ending the customer wants.

## Applying StoryBrand to Small Farming

Small farmers can harness the power of storytelling to create a unique brand identity that resonates with consumers. Here's how the StoryBrand framework can be adapted for small farms:

##### Identify the Character

For small farmers, the character is the consumer who cares about where their food comes from. These customers are looking for fresh, quality products and want to support local agriculture. Understanding this character's desires helps farmers tailor their marketing messages to appeal to these values.

<br>

##### Define the Problem

Consumers often feel disconnected from their food sources and are wary of processed items with unknown ingredients. Small farmers offer a solution to this problem by providing transparency and a personal touch.

<br>

##### Introduce the Guide

As the guide, the farmer's role is to empathize with the customer's quest for healthy, sustainable food. By sharing their knowledge and experience, farmers can build trust and establish themselves as experts who can help consumers make informed choices.

##### <br>

##### Present the Plan

A simple, actionable plan could involve inviting customers to visit the farm, join a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) program, or shop at a local farmers' market. Clear instructions on how to purchase products make it easy for customers to take the next step.

##### <br>

##### Call to Action

A compelling call to action might be an invitation to sign up for a farm newsletter, an offer for a farm tour, or a prompt to "buy now" through an online store. This nudges the customer towards engaging with the farm and its products.

<br>

##### Highlight Avoided Failure

By choosing the farm's products, customers avoid the pitfalls of industrial agriculture, such as environmental harm and health risks. Emphasizing this aspect can make the choice to support the farm feel even more impactful.

<br>

##### Promise Success

The success story for customers is a healthier lifestyle, a stronger local economy, and a more sustainable world. Sharing testimonials and stories of satisfied customers can illustrate this success vividly.

## Storytelling in Action: Real-Life Examples

Imagine a small organic farm that specializes in heirloom tomatoes. Through the StoryBrand lens, their marketing could focus on the customer's desire for flavorful, chemical-free produce (the character with a problem). The farm positions itself as the guide by offering knowledge about organic practices and the health benefits of heirloom varieties. Their plan might include an easy online ordering system, with a call to action to "Order Now for Farm-Fresh Tomatoes." The avoided failure is the consumption of bland, pesticide-laden tomatoes, and the success is the joy of eating delicious, nutritious food grown with care.

## Conclusion

Donald Miller's StoryBrand strategy offers small farmers a framework to craft a compelling narrative that speaks directly to the heart of their customers. By positioning themselves as the guide in their customer's story, farmers can demonstrate their value, build trust, and create a loyal community. In a world where consumers are seeking authenticity and connection, small farmers have a unique opportunity to share their stories and watch their businesses thrive.
